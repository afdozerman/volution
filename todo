opencl evolved images, features that'd be nice:

Features:
-any features at all
-screensaver mode
-(gif to multiple evolved images)

Algorithmstuff:
-split bigger images in smaller (e.g. 100x100px) subimages and evolve them in forked processes/threads.
-refine color palette (but allow deviations with some kind of acceptance)

Implementation:
-C++
-UI maybe in C# or with QT
-platform agnostic would be nice
